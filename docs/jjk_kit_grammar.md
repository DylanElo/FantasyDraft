# JJK Kit Grammar

## Purpose

Battle v2 kits use a Naruto Arena-inspired grammar so character mechanics are readable, testable, and mostly data-driven. A skill should describe what it costs, who it targets, what classes it belongs to, what it does, what conditions gate or modify it, and what counterplay exists.

## Canonical Skill Shape

```python
SkillSpec(
    id="resonance",
    name="Resonance",
    cost=[EnergyType.RED, EnergyType.BLACK],
    cooldown=1,
    target_rule=TargetRule(kind="enemy", required_status="nail_mark"),
    classes=[SkillClass.SOUL, SkillClass.INNATE, SkillClass.INSTANT],
    text="Deal 30 soul damage to a marked enemy.",
    effects=[
        EffectSpec(
            type="damage",
            amount=30,
            damage_type=DamageType.SOUL,
            payload={"condition_status": "nail_mark"},
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Required Four-Skill Layout

Every first-pass character should use this structure:

1. Basic pressure.
2. Signature technique.
3. Setup, defense, counter, or utility.
4. Payoff, Domain, Vow, or transformation.

Allowed extras:

- Zero to two replacement skills.
- Zero to one achievement or passive skill.

## Design Limits

For the first v2 roster:

- Use one major named state per character.
- Use one payoff condition per character.
- Avoid full-canon simulation.
- Avoid requiring players to read many hidden flags.
- Do not allow a one-shot from full HP without at least one prior setup turn.

## Canonical First Creation condition vocabulary

Shipping First Creation kits use the typed `EffectSpec.payload` grammar in
`jjk_arena/battle_v2/effect_payload.py`. A condition belongs to the exact
effect it gates or modifies; `SkillSpec.conditions`/`ConditionSpec` remains a
legacy engine capability used by core tests, but it is not a second canonical
authoring model for new First Creation content.

Supported gates are `condition_status`, `condition_statuses`,
`condition_missing_status`, `condition_user_status`, `condition_user_stacks`,
`condition_target_hp_below`, `condition_original_has_status`,
`condition_original_missing_status`, `condition_recipient_has_status`,
`condition_recipient_missing_status`,
`condition_ally_damaged_target_this_turn`, `condition_scope="original_target"`,
and the registered `conditional_targeting="venom_bloom"` contract.

Supported payoff keys are `bonus_status`, `bonus_user_status`,
`bonus_user_missing_status`, `bonus_amount`, and `damage_bonus`.

Every First Creation skill is schema-validated by `skill_audit.py`; unknown
conditional/bonus keys, invalid value types, and unregistered scopes or
targeting contracts fail the structural audit.

**Implementation note (updated 2026-07-17):** the legacy
`ConditionSpec`/`SkillSpec.conditions` mechanism is used by **zero of the 78
First Creation skills** — an
automated audit (`jjk_arena/battle_v2/skill_audit.py`) confirmed
`total_condition_spec_entries == 0` across the entire roster. All shipped
conditional behavior uses the canonical typed payload keys directly on the `EffectSpec`
that the condition gates or modifies, evaluated inline by the resolver/effects
layer rather than by `conditions.py::evaluate_condition`. The keys actually in
use (see `prepare_conditions` in
`tests/test_first_creation_skill_execution.py` for the full contract):

- `condition_status` / `condition_statuses` — target must have this status (id or one of these ids).
- `condition_missing_status` — target must *not* have this status.
- `condition_user_status` — the caster must have this status.
- `condition_user_stacks` — a `(status_id, minimum_stacks)` pair the caster must meet.
- `condition_target_hp_below` — target's HP must be below this value.
- `condition_original_has_status` / `condition_original_missing_status` — gates against the skill's original (pre-redirect) target.
- `condition_recipient_has_status` / `condition_recipient_missing_status` — gates against the specific effect recipient in a multi-target skill.
- `condition_ally_damaged_target_this_turn` — an ally must have damaged this target already this turn.
- `condition_scope` — narrows which of the above checks against (e.g. `"original_target"`).
- `bonus_status` / `bonus_user_status` / `bonus_user_missing_status` / `bonus_amount` — payoff-only variants that add `bonus_amount` to an effect (typically `damage`) rather than gating legality.
- `conditional_targeting` — a named special-case targeting rule (e.g. `"venom_bloom"`) implemented directly in `resolver.py`, not a generic condition.

This payload-key system is the canonical First Creation grammar. It is fully
implemented, exercised by every conditional shipping skill, covered by the
blanket parametrized cold/warm comparison, and validated against the typed
schema before roster expansion.

## Effect Vocabulary

Initial effect types should include:

- `damage`
- `heal`
- `health_steal`
- `apply_status`
- `apply_team_status`
- `remove_status`
- `cleanse`
- `consume_status_stacks`
- `extend_status`
- `damage_reduction`
- `destructible_defense`
- `invulnerability`
- `stun_classes`
- `counter`
- `reflect`
- `cooldown_increase`
- `cost_modifier`
- `damage_modifier`
- `domain`
- `skill_replacement`

**Implementation note (2026-07-13):** cross-checked against the actual First
Creation roster. `damage`, `heal`, `apply_status`, `apply_team_status`,
`remove_status`, `cleanse`, `consume_status_stacks`, and `extend_status` are
used as literal `EffectSpec.type` values, as documented. `damage_reduction`,
`destructible_defense`, `stun_classes`, and `counter` are used, but as
**payload keys** on an `apply_status` effect's status (e.g.
`status_effect(..., damage_reduction=10)`), not as their own `EffectSpec.type`.
`invulnerability` and `skill_replacement` are used, but under the
implementation names `invulnerable` and `skill_replacements` (plural) — the
same payload-key pattern with a different spelling than documented here.
`cost_modifier` and `damage_modifier` do not exist anywhere in the engine, not
just unused by First Creation — the closest analogues are the `black_cost_delta`
and `damage_bonus`/`damage_output_delta` payload keys, which are narrower and
differently named. `domain`, `health_steal`, `reflect`, and `cooldown_increase`
exist as real engine mechanisms (see `effects.py`, `resolver.py`) but are
genuinely unused by any First Creation skill — consistent with
`docs/decisions/battle_v2_anti_domain.md`, which notes no First Creation
character has a real Domain yet. The documented literal First Creation effect
types also include `apply_team_status`, `cleanse`, `consume_status_stacks`, and
`extend_status`; the vocabulary audit fails if a shipping effect type is
missing from this list.

## Transformation and Replacement Rules

Skill replacements are slot-based and stored on `CharacterState.skill_replacements`:

```python
{"straw_doll_setup": "resonance_detonation"}
```

Replacement duration should be controlled by statuses or transformations, not by checking character names. Examples for future kits include:

- Nobara: Straw Doll Setup to Resonance Detonation.
- Megumi: Ten Shadows Setup to Mahoraga Adaptation.
- Sukuna: Shrine Setup to Cleave.
- Higuruma: Trial to Executioner’s Sword.

## Locked First Creation roster

First Creation ships exactly 19 starter characters and 78 skills. Its canonical
order is:

1. Yuji Itadori
2. Megumi Fushiguro
3. Nobara Kugisaki
4. Maki Zenin
5. Toge Inumaki
6. Panda
7. Aoi Todo
8. Noritoshi Kamo
9. Momo Nishimiya
10. Mai Zenin
11. Kasumi Miwa
12. Kokichi Muta / Mechamaru
13. Junpei Yoshino
14. Satoru Gojo (Young)
15. Suguru Geto (Young)
16. Shoko Ieiri (Young)
17. Utahime Iori (Young)
18. Mei Mei (Young)
19. Yuta Okkotsu (JJK 0)

Adult Gojo, Sukuna variants, Mahito, generic/advanced Yuta variants, Higuruma,
and other advanced identities are mission unlocks rather than account-creation
starters. Later variants may be more complex, but must not make these starters
obsolete.
