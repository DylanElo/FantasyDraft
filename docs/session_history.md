# FantasyDraft Session History

This file records recovered project passes and the current session state so future work can continue from the real repo history instead of scattered chat memory.

After every meaningful pass, add a short dated entry with:

- What changed
- What was verified
- What remains or needs caution
- Relevant commits or pushed state

## 2026-07-09 - Line-ending policy and local verification

Source: local repo check after external zip inspection summary.

What changed:

- Added `.gitattributes` to set a repository line-ending policy.
- Kept normal text files normalized to LF in Git.
- Kept Windows script files (`*.bat`, `*.ps1`) as CRLF on checkout.
- Marked common image formats as binary.

Verification:

- Current working tree started clean on `main`.
- `git diff --stat` and `git diff --ignore-space-at-eol --stat` were empty before the policy change.
- `git ls-files --eol` showed mixed working-tree line endings, confirming the need for an explicit policy.
- `git add --renormalize .` did not produce a mass content rewrite.
- `python -m pytest -q` -> `110 passed, 1 skipped`.
- `node --check web/static/phaser-shell.js`.

Caution / next work:

- This prevents future line-ending churn, but it does not redesign remaining mobile surfaces.
- Next UI work should continue with lobby/draft mobile redesign, stronger battlefield art, attack animation language, and clearer target/queue motion.

Commit:

- `Add repository line ending policy`

Pushed state:

- `main` was pushed to `origin/main` after the pass.

## 2026-07-08 - Mobile combat HUD rebuild

Source: live browser/code pass.

What changed:

- Rebuilt the Phaser combat scene from dense stacked cards into a mobile-first battle HUD.
- Added a compact top domain/turn/energy bar.
- Reworked fighters into large circular touch tokens with portraits, HP bars, status pips, ready/target/queue rings, and larger hit areas.
- Added a central battlefield lane for prompts, replay snippets, and queue chips.
- Rebuilt the bottom command deck with selected-fighter portrait, technique buttons, cost pips, confirm/cancel/end controls, and clearer disabled-state copy.
- Removed generic decorative background circles from the Phaser shell background.
- Fixed a live queue-badge bug where a queued ally action could show `Q1` on the enemy token with the same slot number.
- Updated public-surface tests to assert the new Phaser HUD markers instead of old prototype copy.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/phaser-shell.js`.
- `python -m pytest -q` -> `110 passed, 1 skipped`.
- `git diff --check`.
- Live browser mobile viewport smoke at `390x844` loaded lobby, draft, combat, and queued-action states with no browser console errors.

Caution / next work:

- Combat now has a real mobile game HUD baseline, but it still needs deeper art direction, stronger attack animation language, better draft/lobby mobile treatment, and richer target/queue motion.
- The current central battlefield intentionally leaves space for future animation and event playback; it should not stay visually empty in the final game pass.

Commit:

- `Rebuild Phaser combat as mobile HUD`

Pushed state:

- `main` was pushed to `origin/main` after the pass.

## 2026-07-08 - V2-only cleanup and compact Phaser UI pass

Source: current repo state and live work session.

What changed:

- Replaced the stale `CLAUDE.md` with current Battle v2 project context.
- Removed legacy bot/v1 runtime surfaces and old static Pages/demo output.
- Moved the maintained Battle v2 package to `jjk_arena/battle_v2`.
- Rebuilt `web/app.py` as a v2-only Flask-SocketIO bridge.
- Updated docs and tests to match the v2-only package layout.
- Tightened compact Phaser layout for short screens: smaller draft pages, adjusted navigation, denser combat skill cards, and less crowded effect text.

Verification:

- `python -m pytest -q` -> `110 passed, 1 skipped`.
- `node --check web/static/phaser-shell.js`.
- Local Flask smoke: `GET /` returned HTTP 200.
- Live SocketIO smoke covered CPU practice startup/update and PvP wait/cancel flow.
- Browser smoke confirmed the Phaser lobby, draft, and combat screens loaded.

Caution / next work:

- Phaser UI is functional and less crowded, but the combat screen still needs a dedicated UX refinement pass for responsive spacing, target affordances, queue review clarity, and animation/readability polish.

Commits:

- `d86633d` - `Remove legacy bot code and keep Battle v2 only`
- `6213da3` - `Tighten compact Phaser battle layout`

Pushed state:

- `main` was pushed to `origin/main` and was clean after the pass.

## 2026-07-07 - Push current implementation and keep only main

Source: recovered Codex memory summary.

What changed:

- Committed the staged Phaser mobile arena / first-creation implementation on `main`.
- Pushed `main` to GitHub.
- Removed non-`main` branches locally and remotely as requested.

Verification:

- Final remote branch verification used `git ls-remote --heads origin`.
- Final local branch verification used `git branch --format='%(refname:short)'`.
- End state was only `main` locally and only `refs/heads/main` remotely.

Caution / next work:

- `gh-pages` reappeared once after pruning, likely from deployment automation. For future branch cleanup, delete it again if needed and verify remote heads directly instead of trusting prune output alone.

Commit:

- `ee31454` - `Rewrite v2 client as Phaser mobile arena`

## 2026-07-02 / 2026-07-03 - Repo identity cleanup and first Phaser battle renderer

Source: recovered Codex memory summary.

What changed:

- Removed the old Telegram bot identity at the file/module/runtime level.
- Renamed `jjk_bot` to `jjk_arena`.
- Renamed `main.py` to `run_server.py`.
- Updated imports across `web/`, tests, scripts, and docs.
- Updated `Procfile`, `Dockerfile`, `start_server.bat`, and README to launch `run_server.py`.
- Added `.pytest_cache/` to `.gitignore` after Windows/OneDrive access-denied cleanup issues.
- Added a vendored Phaser presentation layer for the battle screen.
- Mounted the Phaser canvas in the Flask template and pushed battle state into Phaser from the existing DOM/SocketIO client.
- Added battle layout CSS for full-width arena mode versus command-sheet mode.

Verification:

- `python -m pytest -q` -> `44 passed`.
- `node --check web/static/app.js`.
- `node --check web/static/phaser-battle.js`.
- Browser smoke confirmed battle screen load, Phaser canvas mount, skill sheet open, target mode toggle, and arena width restoration after cancel.

Caution / next work:

- This pass was intentionally partial: Phaser was introduced as a presentation layer while DOM/SocketIO still owned interaction and Python stayed authoritative.
- Layout issues appeared around the command sheet overlapping the arena; the working direction was CSS grid/stretch fixes and large-screen spacing, not Phaser state rewrites.
- Browser validation was more reliable through layout rects/screenshots than canvas pixel probing.

Superseded by later work:

- The July 8 pass removed remaining legacy/v1 surfaces and made Battle v2 the only maintained path.

## 2026-07-12 - Persistent Codex project memory

What changed:

- Added root `AGENTS.md` with cross-project product, gameplay, roster, UI/UX, scope, and verification rules.
- Added `jjk_arena/battle_v2/AGENTS.md` with authoritative engine invariants and high-risk starter regressions.
- Added `web/static/phaser/AGENTS.md` with the mobile redesign constitution and client/server parity rules.
- Added `docs/CODEX_PROJECT_MEMORY.md` as the canonical durable record of decisions agreed across design sessions.

Purpose:

- Ensure Codex reloads the project’s agreed constraints on every task instead of relying on chat history.
- Reduce design drift, repeated rediscovery, and accidental scope expansion.

Verification:

- Instruction file byte sizes were checked against Codex’s default combined project-instruction limit.
- The repository instruction chain can be verified with `codex --ask-for-approval never "Summarize the current instructions."` from the repository root and from the relevant nested directory.

Caution:

- `AGENTS.md` is the enforceable concise layer; `docs/CODEX_PROJECT_MEMORY.md` is the detailed canonical memory.
- Open decisions in the memory document still require explicit user approval rather than autonomous resolution.

## 2026-07-12 - Battle v2 authoritative validation hardening

What changed:

- Bound every live caster to declared base skill slots and resolved active replacements only from those slots.
- Rejected foreign/replacement-only skill IDs, empty or duplicate action IDs, incomplete/duplicate queue order, and duplicate or misordered primary/secondary targets.
- Preserved secondary and alternate redirect fields through the real SocketIO cleaner.
- Added explicit `Melee` and `Ranged` tags; melee counters no longer treat all Physical skills as melee.
- Deferred explicitly marked one-shot damage-buff consumption until the complete skill finishes, preserved persistent damage bonuses, corrected helpful/hostile status families, and emitted configured invisible-expiry reveals.
- Added an isolated server-authoritative Planning/Queue Review timer policy module and manager timeout transitions.

Verification:

- Full pytest, Python compilation, and `git diff --check` passed in the clean PR worktree.
- Socket integration coverage traverses Phaser-style payloads through the cleaner, manager, and resolver for Todo and Junpei.

Caution / next work:

- Timer deadlines are authoritative and serialized; production scheduling may poll `expire_phase_if_needed` or invoke it through normal manager/socket entry points.
- No Phaser layout, roster, progression, damage-family aggregation, or anti-domain behavior changed.

## 2026-07-12 - Battle v2 command versioning and idempotency

What changed:

- Added serialized authoritative `state_revision` values for Battle v2 state.
- Required a non-negative revision and non-empty per-player `client_action_nonce` on every post-start mutating SocketIO command.
- Added a bounded manager nonce ledger so identical retries do not execute twice and conflicting nonce reuse is rejected.
- Added stale-intent rejection and transactional rollback of battle state, progression state, RNG state, queues, energy, cooldowns, and logs on command failure.
- Updated Phaser command payloads without changing scenes, layout, interaction flow, or gameplay semantics.
- Made timeout and CPU continuations advance the authoritative revision.

Verification:

- Manager regressions cover successful revision advance, identical retry, stale revision, nonce conflict, and atomic invalid-command rollback.
- Socket integration covers missing metadata, retry idempotency, and stale-command rejection.
- Full pytest, Python compilation, Phaser JavaScript syntax, and `git diff --check` passed in the focused branch.

Caution / next work:

- Nonce receipts are intentionally bounded and in-memory with the room; durable reconnect/resume and multi-process persistence remain separate networking work.
- The client emits unique nonces but does not yet implement an automatic retransmission policy.
- No timer scheduler, reconnect flow, roster, progression, balance, or visual layout changed.

## 2026-07-12 - Scheduled authoritative Battle v2 phase timers

What changed:

- Switched internal Planning and Queue Review deadlines from wall time to a monotonic server clock.
- Added an isolated stale-safe scheduler that actively wakes idle rooms, ignores superseded deadlines, and supports cancellation on room cleanup.
- Serialized whole `phase_seconds_remaining` values for display while keeping expiration decisions server-authoritative.
- Added per-room reentrant locking between player commands and background timeout transitions.
- Broadcast viewer-specific SocketIO state after background expiration and continued CPU rooms automatically before returning control to the player.
- Cleared finished-match deadlines and advanced command revisions for every timeout/CPU continuation.

Verification:

- Deterministic scheduler tests cover duplicate arming, cancellation, and stale wakeups.
- Manager tests cover Planning timeout and valid Queue Review resolution exactly once.
- Real SocketIO integration proves an idle Planning timeout broadcasts and completes the CPU response without a client command.
- Full pytest, Python compilation, and `git diff --check` passed in the focused branch.

Caution / next work:

- Timer state remains process-local with its room; durable multi-process room ownership belongs with reconnect/session persistence.
- Timeout durations and timeout policy were not changed.
- No reconnect flow, roster, progression, balance, Phaser layout, or visual behavior changed.
